########## DELIVERABLE STATUS ##########

Here is what I could do. The login page was done en entirely working. 

The intervention table is set, but since I encountered many problems with the token, I couldn't retrieve the data from the API. And so I could never double check the results obtained.

The Intervention Request form is started, but then again due to login problem, I lacked time to go further and I wouldn't be able to complete it without the token. 

Token problem: Since there was no problem with the login, I continued my work with the Intervention Table. At first it appeared as a hook problem, then as a token value problem (string instead of JWT) and finally I was able to find that the token was extract from the login properly, but is lost as soon as it's passed in the setAuth variable.

For unknown reasons, I'm also unable to deploy. I installed the Heroku, I installed the buildpack, I setup the buildpack in my Heroku settings and it still doesn't recognize anything. 
Command passed: 
$ heroku plugins:install buildpack-registry
$ heroku plugins:install buildpacks
$ heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/facebook/react.git

It's now Monday the 22nd 6:55 am Quebec time and I send my work as it is. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
